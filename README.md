# tennis

This was my first attempt at programming at all, the language of choice was Python 3.

It's a kind of tennis game simulator, to run from the terminal (cd tennis -> python 3 .), but users only wait for the outcome of each point.

The idea is inspired in a TV broadcast of a tennis match and also in the vintage football game Elifoot.

The name and ranking of players are hard coded, based on WTA' Rankings as of July 2nd, 2019. Four players from the Top 10 were randomly chosen, in order to test the algorithm for players possibilities of winning each point, depending on service and general ranking.

It is a WIP, so the next steps are to make the code cleaner (less hard coded), and make it have not only a match but possibly be a small tournament.
